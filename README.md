# Counter-Strike-Winner-Prediction
This is my first in-depth data science project. I have trained various classification algorithms and also checked the changes in their performances when different feature extraction or feature selection techniques are applied on them.
After loading the required libraries and dataset, firstly basic EDA and data cleaning is performed.
Then the data is standardized and dataset is kept in two forms, one being the standardized form and the other being where LDA is performed on the standardized data.
All classification algorithms are trained and tested with both the forms of dataset i.e. with LDA and without LDA.
It is also explored what happens if Recursive Feature Elimination is performed instead of LDA to reduce the dimensions.
Accuracies of all these combinations are measured.
